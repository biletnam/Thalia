Usage notes

This project represents a mock back end of a theater. The theater starts only with seating, and is populated by shows.
Patrons can donate their tickets to other patrons. Users interact with the theater (named Thalia) through REST requests. 
For example, if the user would like view all seating in the theater, he would type:

thalia/webapi/seating
